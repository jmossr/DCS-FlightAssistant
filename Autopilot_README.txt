### Installation
Extract the files from the zip-archive into your
Saved Games\DCS\Scripts folder.

When ready, in Saved Games\DCS\Scripts you should see a folder
'FlightAssistant'.
Folder Saved Games\DCS\Scripts\Hooks should contain
FlightAssistantLoader.lua and maybe more files from other mods.


### Engaging The Autopilot
The autopilot can be engaged or disengaged by pressing a specific
sequence of buttons on the Radio Control Panel.
After pressing a sequence to command the autopilot, the radio can
be switched to any channel again.

- To engage level flight, press: *channel D, channel C, channel B*
- To engage alt and bank angle hold, press: *channel D, channel C, channel A*
- To disengage, press: *channel D, channel C, channel D*
- Pressing the radio 'off' button will also disengage the autopilot

All sequences start with channel D. If channel D is active before you want to
command the autopilot, you must first switch to another channel to be able to
start the sequence with channel D.
